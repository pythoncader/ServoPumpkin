# ServoPumpkin
Original code for the pumpkin with servo-controlled eyes. This code for Arduino boards and PCA9685 PWM controllers loops through each of the 8 servos and chooses a random angle for each one.  
  
Dependencies: Adafruit PWM Servo Driver Library (Use the Library Manager in Arduino to install the Adafruit pwm servo driver library)  

Updated code for multiple routines on both Raspberry Pi and Arduino at these urls:
